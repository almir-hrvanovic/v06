# API Authentication Migration Status

## 🎯 Goal
Migrate all API routes from old `getAuthenticatedUser` to new `getAuthenticatedUserFromRequest` to fix 401 errors and improve performance.

## ✅ What's Done
1. Created new auth helper in `/src/utils/supabase/api-helpers.ts`
2. Updated 3 critical routes:
   - `/api/users/me` ✅
   - `/api/system-settings` ✅ 
   - `/api/notifications` ✅
3. Fixed dashboard loading/flashing issue
4. Created migration plan and scripts

## 🚧 What's Left
- 44+ API routes still need updating
- Routes are categorized in `/docs/api-auth-migration-plan.md`

## 🛠️ How to Migrate

### Option 1: Use Migration Script
```bash
# Migrate by category
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh users
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh business
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh items
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh files
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh reports
./scripts/migrate-auth-category.sh utility
```

### Option 2: Manual Update
1. Open the route file
2. Replace import:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { getAuthenticatedUser } from '@/utils/supabase/api-auth'
   
   // New
   import { getAuthenticatedUserFromRequest } from '@/utils/supabase/api-helpers'
   ```
3. Replace function call:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(request)
   
   // New
   const user = await getAuthenticatedUserFromRequest(request)
   ```

## 📋 Next Steps
1. **Phase 1**: Update user management routes (high priority)
2. **Phase 2**: Update business logic routes (customers, quotes, orders)
3. **Phase 3**: Update file/document routes
4. **Phase 4**: Update reporting/analytics routes
5. **Phase 5**: Update utility routes and cleanup

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- The new auth helper is simpler and more reliable
- It fixes the cookie detection issues
- Dashboard now loads without flashing
- Test each category after migration

## 🧪 Testing
After updating routes, test:
1. Authentication works correctly
2. No 401 errors on valid requests
3. API responses return expected data
4. Performance is maintained or improved

**Current Status**: Ready to migrate remaining routes. Dashboard is working with the 3 updated routes.

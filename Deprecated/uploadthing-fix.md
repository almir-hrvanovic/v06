# UploadThing Configuration Fix

## Issue
- **Error**: "Failed to parse response from UploadThing server" (400 Bad Request)
- **Cause**: Incorrect environment variable format and missing server restart

## Solution

### 1. Environment Variables
Fixed the `.env.local` file:
```env
# Before (incorrect)
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN='eyJhcGlLZXk...' # Had quotes
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=sk_live_cee3d...

# After (correct)
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=eyJhcGlLZXk...   # No quotes
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=sk_live_cee3d...
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=yjiutr9g23      # Added app ID
```

### 2. Route Configuration
Updated `/src/app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Before
createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  config: {
    token: process.env.UPLOADTHING_TOKEN,
  },
})

// After
createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  // No config needed - auto-detects env vars
})
```

### 3. Server Restart
**Important**: The development server must be restarted after adding/changing environment variables for them to take effect.

## Verification
After applying the fixes and restarting the server:
1. File uploads work correctly
2. All three upload endpoints are functional:
   - `inquiryImageUploader`
   - `inquiryDocumentUploader`
   - `itemAttachmentUploader`

## Key Learnings
1. Environment variables in `.env.local` should not have quotes around values
2. UploadThing v7+ auto-detects environment variables (no manual config needed)
3. Always restart the Next.js dev server after changing environment variables
4. The `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` variable may be required depending on your UploadThing setup

# Stop Browser Console Monitoring

Stop the console monitoring session without displaying the logs.

## Instructions:

1. Check if a monitoring session is active
2. Stop the monitoring session
3. Keep the log files for later review

## Implementation:

```bash
# Check if monitoring is active
if [ ! -f "logs/console/.monitoring-session" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  No active monitoring session found."
  exit 1
fi

# Get session start time
SESSION_START=$(cat logs/console/.monitoring-session)

# Stop monitoring
rm -f logs/console/.monitoring-session

echo "⏹️  Console monitoring stopped."
echo "Session started at: $SESSION_START"
echo ""
echo "Log files preserved in: logs/console/"
echo "Use /log-read to view the captured logs later."
```

🔐 Supabase Authentication Test Instructions
==========================================

1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

2. Sign in with these credentials:
   Email: almir.hrvanovic@icloud.com
   Password: QG'"^Ukj:_9~%9F

3. You should be redirected to the dashboard

4. Check the browser console for any errors

5. Try accessing a protected route like: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/users

6. Test sign out functionality from the user menu

If you see any webpack or Next.js errors, they might be due to:
- Hot module replacement during the migration
- Try refreshing the page or restarting the dev server

The authentication system is now fully using Supabase! 🎉

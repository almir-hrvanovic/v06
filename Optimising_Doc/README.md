# Performance Optimization Master Plan

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Issue Resolution Protocol

**Before starting ANY work, read [ISSUE_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md](./ISSUE_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md)**

> "Don't Assume - Consult Documentation! Think HARD, analyse issue, use detailed loggings, find solution that is in sync with project logic and planned activities, Update documentation with issues and solutions. Repeat if needed until all fixed."

### Quick Links for Issue Resolution

- 📚 [Project Documentation](../CLAUDE.md) - ALWAYS consult first
- 🔍 [Master Issue Log](./Issues/MASTER-ISSUE-LOG.md) - Search before debugging
- 📊 [Logging Standards](./Templates/logging-standards.md) - How to implement detailed logging
- 💡 [Solutions Database](./Issues/solutions-database.md) - Proven solutions

## 🎯 Performance Targets

- API Response Time: < 200ms (p95)
- Page Load Time: < 2s
- Database Query Time: < 50ms (p95)
- Memory Usage: < 512MB per instance
- CPU Usage: < 70% under normal load

## 📋 Optimization Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Setup ✅

- [x] Set up monitoring infrastructure
- [x] Establish baseline metrics (27s load time)
- [x] Create rollback procedures
- [x] Document current performance bottlenecks

**Status**: COMPLETED | **Issues**: [View](./00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md)

**Key Findings**:

- Database Abstraction: 8-12s overhead
- Auth Bottleneck: 5-8s per request
- Zero Caching: 6-10s wasted

- Bundle Size: 3-5s unoptimized

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1) ✅

- [x] Implement Redis caching layer
- [x] Optimize authentication flow
- [x] Add basic API caching headers
- [x] Implement request batching (better than deduplication)

**Status**: COMPLETED | **Issues**: [View](./01-Quick-Wins/issues-and-solutions.md)

**Key Achievements**:
- Redis caching: 16-26x API performance improvement
- Auth optimization: 95% reduction in auth time
- API optimization: 80-95% response time reduction
- Total page load improvement: 20-25 seconds (74-93%)

### Phase 2: Database Optimization (Week 2)

- [ ] Create materialized views for reports
- [ ] Optimize complex queries
- [ ] Implement proper indexing strategy
- [ ] Add query result caching

**Status**: Not Started | **Issues**: [View](./02-Database-Optimization/issues-and-solutions.md)

### Phase 3: Frontend Optimization (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Implement service workers

**Status**: Not Started | **Issues**: [View](./03-Frontend-Optimization/issues-and-solutions.md)

### Phase 4: Backend Optimization (Week 4)

- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request queuing
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Implement async processing

**Status**: Not Started | **Issues**: [View](./04-Backend-Optimization/issues-and-solutions.md)

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Scaling (Week 5)

- [ ] Set up load balancing
- [ ] Implement CDN
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling
- [ ] Optimize container resources

**Status**: Not Started | **Issues**: [View](./05-Infrastructure-Scaling/issues-and-solutions.md)

## 📊 Progress Tracking

| Phase | Progress | Issues | Blockers | ETA |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Foundation | 100% ✅ | 5 (5 resolved) | 0 | Completed |
| Quick Wins | 100% ✅ | 10 (10 resolved) | 0 | Completed |
| Database | 0% | 0 | 0 | Week 2 |
| Frontend | 0% | 0 | 0 | Week 3 |
| Backend | 0% | 0 | 0 | Week 4 |
| Infrastructure | 0% | 0 | 0 | Week 5 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the Protocol**: Start with [ISSUE_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md](./ISSUE_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md)
2. **Check Current State**: Review baseline metrics in [00-Foundation/baseline-metrics.md](./00-Foundation/baseline-metrics.md)
3. **Set Up Logging**: Implement logging as per [Templates/logging-standards.md](./Templates/logging-standards.md)
4. **Start Phase 1**: Begin with [01-Quick-Wins/redis-caching.md](./01-Quick-Wins/redis-caching.md)

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **Never assume** - always check documentation first
2. **Log everything** - use OptimizationLogger for all operations
3. **Document issues** - update issues-and-solutions.md immediately
4. **Test rollback** - ensure you can revert any change
5. **Measure impact** - compare metrics before and after each change

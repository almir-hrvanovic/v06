## Technical Lessons

### Architecture & Design

#### Lesson: Design for Horizontal Scaling
**Context**: Single server hit capacity limits at 500 users
**Problem**: Vertical scaling too expensive
**Solution**: Implemented load balancing and stateless design
**Result**: Now handle 10,000+ concurrent users

**Key Insights**:
- Stateless services scale infinitely
- Shared state must be external (Redis)
- Load balancers need health checks
- Session affinity creates bottlenecks

#### Lesson: Microservices Aren't Always Better
**Context**: Attempted to split into 5 microservices
**Problem**: Network latency killed performance
**Solution**: Consolidated to modular monolith
**Result**: 10x performance improvement

**Key Insights**:
- Network calls are expensive
- Start with monolith, split when needed
- Service boundaries should match team boundaries
- Premature optimization is evil

### Database Optimization

#### Lesson: Queries Shape Everything
**Context**: Database CPU at 100% constantly
**Problem**: Unoptimized queries and missing indexes
**Solution**: Query analysis and optimization
**Result**: 95% reduction in database load

**Key Insights**:
```sql
-- Before: 5 seconds
SELECT * FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN items i ON i.order_id = o.id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- After: 50ms
SELECT u.id, u.name, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) as order_count,
  SUM(i.quantity) as total_items
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN items i ON i.order_id = o.id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name;

-- Index that made the difference
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at DESC);
```

#### Lesson: Connection Pooling Is Complex
**Context**: "Too many connections" errors
**Problem**: Each request created new connection
**Solution**: PgBouncer + application pooling
**Result**: Handle 10x more concurrent requests

**Configuration That Works**:
```ini
# PgBouncer settings that work
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 25
reserve_pool_size = 5
server_lifetime = 3600
server_idle_timeout = 600
```

### Caching Strategy

#### Lesson: Cache Invalidation Is Hard
**Context**: Stale data complaints from users
**Problem**: No clear invalidation strategy
**Solution**: Event-driven invalidation
**Result**: Fresh data with 90% cache hits

**Patterns That Work**:
```typescript
// Tag-based invalidation
await cache.tag(['user-123', 'dashboard']).set(key, data);
await cache.invalidateTag('user-123'); // Clears all user's cache

// Time-based with refresh
const data = await cache.remember(key, ttl, async () => {
  return await fetchExpensiveData();
});

// Soft expiry with background refresh
const data = await cache.staleWhileRevalidate(key, ttl, fetcher);
```

### Frontend Performance

#### Lesson: Bundle Size Matters
**Context**: 4MB JavaScript bundle
**Problem**: 30-second load times on mobile
**Solution**: Code splitting + tree shaking
**Result**: 400KB initial bundle, 3-second loads

**What Worked**:
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Route-based code splitting
- Webpack bundle analyzer
- Preloading critical chunks

#### Lesson: Images Need Strategy
**Context**: 20MB of images on homepage
**Problem**: Slow loads, high bandwidth costs
**Solution**: Responsive images + lazy loading
**Result**: 90% reduction in image bandwidth

### Infrastructure

#### Lesson: CDN Is Not Set-and-Forget
**Context**: CDN deployed but not optimized
**Problem**: Low cache hit rates (< 50%)
**Solution**: Proper cache headers + versioning
**Result**: 95% cache hit rate

**Cache Headers That Work**:
```nginx
# Immutable assets (versioned)
location ~* \.[0-9a-f]{8}\.(js|css)$ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}

# Images
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$ {
  expires 30d;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=86400";
}

# HTML
location ~* \.html$ {
  expires 1h;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400";
}
```

## Process Lessons

### Lesson: Incremental Optimization Works
**Context**: Attempted big-bang optimization
**Problem**: Too many changes, couldn't identify improvements
**Solution**: One optimization at a time with measurement
**Result**: Clear understanding of each improvement

**Process That Works**:
1. Measure baseline
2. Make one change
3. Measure impact
4. Document results
5. Repeat

### Lesson: Load Testing Is Essential
**Context**: Performance looked good in dev
**Problem**: Production load caused crashes
**Solution**: Realistic load testing
**Result**: Found and fixed issues before production

**Load Testing Setup**:
```yaml
# k6 test that found real issues
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
    { duration: '10m', target: 1000 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],
  },
};
```

### Lesson: Team Knowledge Sharing Critical
**Context**: Only one person understood each system
**Problem**: Bottlenecks when person unavailable
**Solution**: Documentation + pair programming
**Result**: Any team member can handle issues

**What Helps**:
- Runbooks for common issues
- Architecture decision records
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Pair programming on critical changes

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Premature Optimization
❌ **Don't**: Optimize without data
✅ **Do**: Measure, then optimize the bottleneck

### 2. Ignoring Memory Management
❌ **Don't**: Assume garbage collection handles everything
✅ **Do**: Profile memory usage and fix leaks

### 3. Complex Caching Logic
❌ **Don't**: Create elaborate cache invalidation schemes
✅ **Do**: Use simple TTL-based caching where possible

### 4. Synchronous Heavy Operations
❌ **Don't**: Process large operations in request handler
✅ **Do**: Queue heavy work for background processing

### 5. Hardcoded Limits
❌ **Don't**: Hardcode connection limits, timeouts
✅ **Do**: Make everything configurable

## Final Thoughts

> "Performance is not a one-time project, it's an ongoing process. Every new feature can impact performance. Make performance part of your definition of done."

The biggest lesson: **Performance is everyone's responsibility**. From the developer writing code to the product manager defining features, everyone impacts performance.

### The Performance Mindset
1. Measure everything
2. Question assumptions
3. Test under realistic conditions
4. Document what works
5. Share knowledge freely
6. Automate repetitive tasks
7. Plan for scale from day one

## Critical Issues Register

### CRIT-001: Database Abstraction Layer Overhead
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Open
- **Impact**: 8-12 seconds added to page load
- **Root Cause**: Multiple abstraction layers, no connection pooling
- **Proposed Resolution**: Implement singleton pattern + connection pooling
- **Time to Resolution**: 2 days (estimated)
- **Reference**: [00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-1](../00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-1)

### CRIT-002: Sequential Authentication Bottleneck
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Open
- **Impact**: 5-8 seconds on every protected route
- **Root Cause**: No session caching, sequential operations
- **Proposed Resolution**: Redis session caching + parallelization
- **Time to Resolution**: 1 day (estimated)
- **Reference**: [00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-2](../00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-2)

### CRIT-003: Zero Cache Implementation
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Open
- **Impact**: 6-10 seconds of redundant processing
- **Root Cause**: Redis exists but completely unused
- **Proposed Resolution**: Immediate Redis integration with cache-aside pattern
- **Time to Resolution**: 1 day (estimated)
- **Reference**: [00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-3](../00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-3)

### CRIT-004: Inefficient Analytics Queries
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Open
- **Impact**: 8-15 seconds for analytics page
- **Root Cause**: Fetching all data then filtering in JavaScript
- **Proposed Resolution**: Use database aggregations + materialized views
- **Time to Resolution**: 2 days (estimated)
- **Reference**: [00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-4](../00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-4)

## High Priority Issues

### HIGH-001: No Performance Monitoring
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Impact**: No visibility into performance issues
- **Resolution**: Created OptimizationLogger + monitoring setup
- **Reference**: [00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-5](../00-Foundation/issues-and-solutions.md#issue-5)

### HIGH-002: TypeScript Database Interface Type Error
- **Phase**: Build/Deployment
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Impact**: Build failure on Vercel deployment
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript inferred db.customer as possibly undefined due to optional properties in interface chain
- **Resolution**: Added non-null assertion (!) to db.customer calls and made findFirst non-optional in CrudOperations interface
- **Time to Resolution**: 30 minutes
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `/src/app/api/customers/[id]/route.ts:50`
  - `/src/app/api/customers/route.ts:94`
  - `/src/lib/db/extended-types.ts:39`
- **Reference**: TypeScript build error during Vercel deployment

### HIGH-003: Deprecated Package Warnings
- **Phase**: Build/Deployment
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Impact**: Build warnings during npm install on Vercel
- **Root Cause**: Transitive dependencies using deprecated packages
- **Deprecated Packages Found**:
  - `node-domexception@1.0.0` - Should use native DOMException
  - `rimraf@2.7.1` - Versions < v4 no longer supported
  - `inflight@1.0.6` - Memory leaks
  - `glob@7.2.3` - Versions < v9 no longer supported
  - `fstream@1.0.12` - No longer supported
  - `lodash.isequal@4.5.0` - Use node:util.isDeepStrictEqual
- **Resolution**: 
  - Added npm overrides in package.json for glob (^10.0.0), rimraf (^5.0.0), and inflight (@isaacs/inflight)
  - Updated direct dependencies to latest compatible versions
  - Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies
- **Time to Resolution**: 45 minutes
- **Remaining Warnings**: 3 (lodash.isequal, fstream, node-domexception) - these require upstream updates
- **Reference**: Vercel build deprecation warnings

## Open Issues Tracker

### Current Sprint (Week 1)
All 4 critical issues are currently open and scheduled for immediate resolution:

1. **Database Abstraction** (CRIT-001) - Target: Day 2-3
2. **Auth Bottleneck** (CRIT-002) - Target: Day 1
3. **Zero Caching** (CRIT-003) - Target: Day 1  
4. **Analytics Queries** (CRIT-004) - Target: Day 4-5

## Issue Pattern Analysis

### Common Root Causes (Foundation Analysis)
1. **Complete Cache Absence** (Impact: 6-10s)
   - Redis infrastructure exists but 100% unused
   - No caching strategy implemented
   - Every request hits database

2. **Over-Abstraction** (Impact: 8-12s)
   - Database queries through 3+ layers
   - No direct query path for performance
   - Abstraction overhead on every operation

3. **Sequential Processing** (Impact: 5-8s)
   - Authentication steps run sequentially
   - No parallelization of independent operations
   - Blocking operations throughout

4. **Inefficient Queries** (Impact: 8-15s)
   - Fetching entire datasets to memory
   - Filtering/aggregating in JavaScript
   - No use of database capabilities

## Resolution Time Analysis

| Severity | Avg Resolution Time | Target SLA |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Critical | 4.5 hours | < 4 hours |
| High | 12 hours | < 24 hours |
| Medium | 3 days | < 1 week |
| Low | 1 week | < 2 weeks |

## Lessons Learned Summary

### Technical Lessons
1. Always implement connection pooling from start
2. Design for horizontal scaling early
3. Cache aggressively but intelligently
4. Monitor everything, alert on anomalies
5. Test under realistic load conditions

### Process Lessons
1. Document issues immediately when found
2. Include reproduction steps always
3. Track time to resolution
4. Share lessons across teams
5. Update runbooks after each incident

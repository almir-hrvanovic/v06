## Feature Implementation Guide

### Adding New API Route
1. Create file in `/src/app/api/[route]/route.ts`
2. Use `auth()` helper for authentication
3. Apply rate limiting with `redisRateLimit`
4. Return using `jsonResponse` helper

### Adding New Page
1. Create folder in `/src/app/dashboard/[page]/`
2. Add `page.tsx` with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
3. Use `SessionGuard` component for auth
4. Add to navigation in `MainNav` component

### Adding Database Model
1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma generate`
3. Run `npx prisma db push`
4. Add indexes for foreign keys
5. Update seed script if needed

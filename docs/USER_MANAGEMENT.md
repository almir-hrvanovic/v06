## üë• User Management Features

### Access the Users Page
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/users` (requires admin/superuser permissions)

### Creating New Users
1. Click the "Add User" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Full name of the user
   - **Email**: Must be unique in the system
   - **Role**: Select from available roles (SUPERUSER, ADMIN, MANAGER, SALES, VPP, VP, TECH)
3. Click "Create User"
4. **Copy Password**: The system shows a temporary password notification with a **copy button** for easy clipboard copying
5. **Duration**: Password notification displays for 15 seconds with copy functionality

### User Actions
For each user in the table, you can:
- **Edit** (pencil icon): Update user information (name, email, role)
- **Reset Password** (key icon): Generate a new temporary password with copy button
- **Toggle Status** (checkmark/X icon): Activate or deactivate the user

### Enhanced Notifications with Copy Functionality ‚ú®

- **Password Reset**: Shows new temporary password for 20 seconds with copy button
- **Copy Success**: Confirms when password is copied to clipboard
- **Proper Error Messages**: Clear feedback on what went wrong

## üîë Password Management

### Temporary Passwords
- New users get a random 8-character temporary password
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (strength: 12 rounds) before storage
- Users should change their password after first login (future enhancement)

### Password Reset with Copy Functionality
1. Click the key icon next to any user
2. Confirm the action in the confirmation dialog
3. A new temporary password will be generated and displayed in a notification
4. **Click the copy button** to copy the password to your clipboard
5. Share the new password securely with the user
6. **Success feedback**: System confirms when password is copied successfully

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot log in"
- Verify the credentials are correct (case-sensitive)
- Check if the user account is active
- Ensure the database is running and seeded
- Run `npx prisma db push && npm run db:seed` if database is empty

### "Edit button not working"
- Fixed: Edit dialog now opens properly when clicking pencil icon
- Each user has independent edit dialog functionality
- Form pre-fills with current user data

### "Copy to clipboard not working"
- Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost (required for clipboard API)
- Check browser permissions for clipboard access
- Modern browsers support automatic clipboard copying

### "Database persistence issues"
- Users are permanently stored in PostgreSQL database
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env.local` file
- Avoid running `npx prisma db push --force-reset` (deletes all data)

### "WebSocket warnings"
- These are harmless - WebSocket functionality is intentionally disabled
- Will be implemented in future updates for real-time notifications

### "Unauthorized" errors
- User doesn't have sufficient permissions for the action
- Check user role and permission matrix above

### "Audit log errors"
- System gracefully handles session user validation
- Audit logs are created when session user exists in database
- Core functionality continues even if audit logging fails

Authentication Setup

  - Supabase User Created: almir.hrvanovic@icloud.com
  - Password: QG'"^Ukj:_9~%9F
  - User ID: c31e75f3-4e0b-480b-8942-df6b8a893088

  🏗️ Architecture Changes

  1. Removed NextAuth completely from the project
  2. Created unified auth system with dynamic provider support
  3. Updated all components to use the new useAuth() hook
  4. Configured middleware to protect routes with Supabase sessions

  📁 Key Files

  - Auth Hook: /src/hooks/use-auth.ts
  - Auth Config: /src/lib/auth-config.ts (set to 'supabase')
  - API Auth: /src/utils/supabase/api-auth.ts
  - Sign In Page: /src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx

  🚀 Next Steps

  1. Start your dev server: npm run dev
  2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
  3. Sign in with the credentials above
  4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard

  The authentication system is fully migrated and tested! 🎉


  ## How It Works Now:

  1. Just start the dev server: npm run dev
  2. Automatic login happens: No manual steps needed!
  3. Check console for confirmation messages
  4. You're logged in as almir.hrvanovic@icloud.com (SUPERUSER)

  The system will now automatically log you in every time you start the dev server or
   when your session expires. No more manual logins needed during development!
